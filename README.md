# Lazytube 1.0
Made by Sijian Deng, Sijia Chen, Yi Xiao and David Zhou during Facebook Hackathon 2017

Lazytube is a handy tool that intends to pause and resume video/music playbackfor you when you leave or return to your computer. It uses OpenCV for face recognition and works best with a front camera.

Version 1.0 is a simple Python script that hits the SPACE bar whenever your face appears or disappears in the camera vision. It runs as long as you have OpenCV installed on your computer and grants the script sufficient permission (eg. access to camera and keyboard).
